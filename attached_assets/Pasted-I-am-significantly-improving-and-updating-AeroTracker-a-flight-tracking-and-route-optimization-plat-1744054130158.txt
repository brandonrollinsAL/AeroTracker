I am significantly improving and updating AeroTracker, a flight tracking and route optimization platform within the AeroLink ecosystem, which connects pilots, flight students, instructors, and enthusiasts worldwide, with the goal of becoming the number one aviation platform globally by 2030. The current AeroTracker interface (as shown in the provided image) is functional but lacks a polished, user-friendly design, modern interactivity, and comprehensive features, making it less engaging and efficient for flight tracking and route optimization. As a UX/UI expert with extensive experience, I want to transform AeroTracker into a visually stunning, intuitive, and feature-rich platform that surpasses industry standards, with an aviation-themed design that reflects AeroLink’s brand identity. The updated AeroTracker must enhance the existing flight tracking and route optimization interface, address usability issues, and add new functionalities to support pilots in tracking flights and optimizing routes. It must be fully functional across iOS Mobile, iPad iOS, Android, and web platforms, with all features consistently available and optimized for each platform’s native capabilities. The app must be a Progressive Web App (PWA), supporting offline capabilities, and be compatible with Replit Autoscale Deployments for scaling. Eliminate all external API integrations, using static mock data stored in Replit Key-Value Store for structured data (e.g., flight:${flightId}, airport:${airportId}) and Replit Object Storage for files (e.g., bucket: flight-data), and apply the AeroLink color scheme for uniform branding. Focus on delivering the best UI/UX ever for a flight tracking and route optimization platform, ensuring ease of use, engagement, and accessibility.
