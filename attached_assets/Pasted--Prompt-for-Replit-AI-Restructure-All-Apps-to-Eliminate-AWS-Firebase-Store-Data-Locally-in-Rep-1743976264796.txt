### Prompt for Replit AI: Restructure All Apps to Eliminate AWS/Firebase, Store Data Locally in Replit, and Use Replit for Scaling

**Prompt:**

I am developing multiple web platforms, including AeroLink (an aviation-focused social platform) and others, aimed at becoming the leading applications in their respective industries. Currently, these apps rely on AWS and/or Firebase for backend services (e.g., Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage, Firebase Cloud Functions). I am facing issues with Firebase, specifically with generating a Service Account Key due to organizational policy restrictions (`iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`) and permissions errors (e.g., "Key creation is not allowed on this service account" and "IAM policy update failed: Only service accounts can be granted ServiceAgent roles"). To resolve this, I want to completely eliminate dependencies on AWS and Firebase, restructure the entire codebase to store all data locally within Replit’s ecosystem (using Replit’s Key-Value Store or Object Storage), and leverage Replit’s Autoscale Deployments for scaling. Your task is to debug, restructure, and ensure all functionality is retained, following the highest standards in UX/UI, software development, social media engagement, e-commerce, and industry-specific features.

#### Current Technology Stack (Before Restructuring)
- **Frontend**: React (v18.2.0+) with TypeScript, WebAssembly for performance-heavy tasks.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for NoSQL, Functions for serverless logic, Storage for files, Authentication for user management) or AWS equivalents (if applicable).
- **Maps**: ArcGIS API for JavaScript (for AeroLink), integrated with FlightAware API for real-time flight tracking and AVWX API for METAR weather data.
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for scoped styles, global styles in `/styles/global.css`, Brotli compression for assets.
- **State Management**: React Context API for lightweight needs; Redux with lazy loading for complex state.
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Cloudflare CDN for optimized builds and delivery.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication via `/ws` path (e.g., for live updates in AeroLink).

#### Restructuring Goals
- **Eliminate AWS/Firebase Dependencies**:
  - Remove all Firebase services (Firestore, Authentication, Storage, Functions) and AWS equivalents (e.g., Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda).
  - Replace Firebase Authentication with a custom authentication system using Replit’s Key-Value Store for user data.
  - Replace Firestore with Replit’s Key-Value Store for structured data (e.g., user profiles, posts, flight logs).
  - Replace Firebase Storage with Replit Object Storage for files (e.g., user-uploaded images, flight logs).
  - Replace Firebase Cloud Functions with Express routes in `server/index.ts`.
- **Store Data Locally in Replit**:
  - Use **Replit Key-Value Store** for all structured data (e.g., users, posts, flight logs, orders).
  - Use **Replit Object Storage** for unstructured data (e.g., images, documents, JSON files).
  - Avoid Replit’s Scratch Disk for persistent data, as it’s temporary and not shared across Autoscale instances.
- **Scaling with Replit**:
  - Use **Replit Autoscale Deployments** to automatically scale the app from 0 to many instances based on traffic.
  - Ensure the app is **stateless**, storing all data in Replit Key-Value Store or Object Storage to support concurrent access across instances.
  - Configure the app to listen on `0.0.0.0` and external port 80, handling HTTP, HTTP/2, WebSockets, or gRPC requests without background activities outside request handling.

#### Core Features to Retain (Generalized for All Apps)
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication with email/password login, MFA, and session management using Replit Key-Value Store.
- **Industry-Specific Features**: Retain functionality tailored to each app’s domain (e.g., flight logging for AeroLink, product listings for e-commerce, content sharing for social media).
- **E-Commerce (if applicable)**: Streamlined checkout with virtual try-on (AR), subscription models, dynamic pricing, bundle discounts, and a user marketplace.
- **Social Features (if applicable)**: Live streaming, hashtag system, collaborative posts, verified profiles, gamification (badges, challenges), and VR community spaces.
- **Groups/Communities (if applicable)**: Role-based access control (RBAC), group events, and community challenges.
- **Notifications**: Personalized push (via Web Push API), in-app, and email alerts with sentiment analysis for engagement.

#### Restructuring Steps
1. **Remove Firebase/AWS Dependencies**:
   - Delete all Firebase SDK imports (e.g., `firebase/app`, `firebase/firestore`, `firebase/auth`, `firebase/storage`) from the codebase.
   - Remove Firebase configuration (e.g., `src/firebaseConfig.js`) and environment variables (e.g., `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`).
   - Remove AWS SDKs and configurations if present.
2. **Set Up Replit Key-Value Store**:
   - Import Replit’s database library in `server/index.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import { Database } from "@replit/database";
     const db = new Database();
     ```
   - Create a schema for structured data (e.g., users, posts, orders, flight logs) and store them in the Key-Value Store. Example:
     ```typescript
     // Store a user
     await db.set(`user:${userId}`, { email, passwordHash, role, createdAt });
     // Retrieve a user
     const user = await db.get(`user:${userId}`);
     ```
3. **Set Up Replit Object Storage**:
   - Use Replit Object Storage for files:
     ```typescript
     import { ObjectStorage } from "@replit/object-storage";
     const storage = new ObjectStorage();

     // Upload a file (e.g., user profile image)
     await storage.upload({ bucket: "user-files", path: `profile-${userId}.jpg`, content: fileBuffer });

     // Retrieve a file
     const file = await storage.download({ bucket: "user-files", path: `profile-${userId}.jpg` });
     ```
   - Create buckets for different data types (e.g., `user-files`, `flight-logs`).
4. **Replace Authentication**:
   - Implement a custom authentication system:
     - Store user credentials in the Key-Value Store (e.g., `user:${userId}`).
     - Use bcrypt to hash passwords:
       ```typescript
       import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

       const saltRounds = 10;
       const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
       await db.set(`user:${userId}`, { email, passwordHash });
       ```
     - Implement login with session tokens using JSON Web Tokens (JWT):
       ```typescript
       import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

       const token = jwt.sign({ userId }, 'your-jwt-secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });
       ```
     - Add MFA using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) with a library like `otplib`.
5. **Replace Database Operations**:
   - Migrate Firestore collections to Replit Key-Value Store:
     - Users: `user:${userId}` (e.g., `{ email, passwordHash, role }`)
     - Posts: `post:${postId}` (e.g., `{ userId, content, createdAt }`)
     - Flight Logs (AeroLink): `flight:${flightId}` (e.g., `{ userId, route, duration }`)
     - Orders (E-Commerce): `order:${orderId}` (e.g., `{ userId, items, total }`)
   - Implement CRUD operations using the Key-Value Store:
     ```typescript
     // Create
     await db.set(`post:${postId}`, { userId, content, createdAt });

     // Read
     const post = await db.get(`post:${postId}`);

     // Update
     const post = await db.get(`post:${postId}`);
     await db.set(`post:${postId}`, { ...post, content: newContent });

     // Delete
     await db.delete(`post:${postId}`);
     ```
   - For listing data (e.g., all posts), use `db.list()` with prefixes:
     ```typescript
     const postKeys = await db.list("post:");
     const posts = await Promise.all(postKeys.map(key => db.get(key)));
     ```
6. **Replace Storage**:
   - Migrate files from Firebase Storage to Replit Object Storage:
     - Profile images: `user-files/profile-${userId}.jpg`
     - Flight log files (AeroLink): `flight-logs/log-${flightId}.json`
   - Update upload/download logic in `server/index.ts` to use Object Storage.
7. **Replace Cloud Functions**:
   - Move all Firebase Cloud Functions logic to Express routes in `server/index.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import express from 'express';
     const app = express();

     app.use(express.json());

     app.post('/api/posts', async (req, res) => {
       const { userId, content } = req.body;
       const postId = generateUniqueId(); // Implement a function to generate IDs
       await db.set(`post:${postId}`, { userId, content, createdAt: Date.now() });
       res.status(201).json({ postId });
     });

     app.listen(80, '0.0.0.0', () => {
       console.log('Server running on port 80');
     });
     ```
8. **Update Frontend**:
   - Remove Firebase SDK calls from the frontend (e.g., `firebase/firestore`, `firebase/auth`).
   - Update API calls to use the new Express endpoints:
     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch('/api/posts', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ userId, content }),
     });
     ```
   - Update WebSocket connections to use the Express server’s `/ws` path.
9. **Retain All Functionality**:
   - **Authentication**: Replace Firebase Authentication with the custom system (email/password, MFA, JWT).
   - **Industry-Specific Features**: Retain functionality (e.g., flight logging for AeroLink using ArcGIS API, FlightAware, and AVWX; product listings for e-commerce).
   - **E-Commerce**: Use Replit Key-Value Store for orders and Object Storage for product images.
   - **Social Features**: Store posts, comments, and likes in the Key-Value Store; use WebSocket for live updates.
   - **Groups**: Store group data and events in the Key-Value Store.
   - **Notifications**: Implement push notifications using Web Push API, store notification data in the Key-Value Store.

#### Design and UI/UX Guidelines
- **Adaptive Onboarding**: Tailor onboarding based on user roles with voice-guided tutorials.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Offer industry-inspired themes with high-contrast mode and custom icons.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Add animations (e.g., 0.3s button ripples, loading spinners).
