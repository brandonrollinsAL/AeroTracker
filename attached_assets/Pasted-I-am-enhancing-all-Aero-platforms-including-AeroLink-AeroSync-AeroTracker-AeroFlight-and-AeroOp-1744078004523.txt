I am enhancing all Aero platforms, including AeroLink, AeroSync, AeroTracker, AeroFlight, and AeroOps, within the AeroLink ecosystem, which connects pilots, flight students, instructors, and enthusiasts worldwide, with the goal of becoming the number one aviation platform globally by 2030. I want to integrate an Open AI API to populate the platforms’ airport and navigation databases with comprehensive data for all airports worldwide, as well as the aircraft databases with performance specifications for every possible aircraft. The Open AI API integration must retrieve specific airport data, including frequencies, location, available services, FBOs, runway information, diagrams, available approaches, STARs, SIDs, and standard taxi routes where applicable, and add this data into the AeroLink database for use across all platforms. Additionally, the integration must populate the aircraft databases with relevant performance specifications available through Open AI for every single aircraft, ensuring all platforms have access to this data. The integration must be seamless, maintaining the existing design and functionality of the platforms while adding the new data. The platforms are fully functional across iOS Mobile, iPad iOS, Android, and web platforms, with features consistently available and optimized for each platform’s native capabilities. They are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), supporting offline capabilities, and are compatible with Replit Autoscale Deployments for scaling. Use static mock data stored in Replit Key-Value Store for structured data and Replit Object Storage for files, ensuring no external API integrations beyond the Open AI API. Apply the AeroLink color scheme for uniform branding, and focus on ensuring the platforms deliver the best user experience with the newly populated data, maintaining their aviation-themed design and functionality.

AeroLink Platform Color Scheme
Ensure the following color scheme is used consistently across all UI elements for uniform branding:

Primary AeroLink Color: #4995fd (AeroLink Blue)
Apply to primary buttons, interactive elements, flight routes, and key highlights.
Secondary Color: #003a65 (Deep Blue)
Apply to text, dark accents, and backgrounds for high-contrast elements.
Third Color: #a0d0ec (Sky Light Blue)
Apply to backgrounds, secondary elements, and subtle highlights.
Aero Platforms Overview
The Aero platforms (AeroLink, AeroSync, AeroTracker, AeroFlight, AeroOps) are a suite of web-based tools designed to support various aviation-related functionalities, including social networking (AeroLink), flight school management (AeroSync), flight tracking (AeroTracker), flight planning (AeroFlight), and airline/charter company management (AeroOps). The platforms must:

Maintain all existing design elements, including layouts, UI components, and aviation-themed aesthetics (e.g., sky gradients, animated clouds, aviation sound effects).
Preserve all existing functionality, ensuring no features are altered or removed during the integration.
Integrate the Open AI API to populate the airport and navigation databases with global airport data and the aircraft databases with performance specifications, making this data available across all platforms.
Open AI API Integration for Airport and Navigation Database
