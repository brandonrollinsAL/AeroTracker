I am standardizing the branding across all AeroLink platforms (AeroLink, AeroSync, AeroTracker, AeroFlight) to ensure a uniform look and feel, aligning with AeroLink’s vision of becoming the number one aviation platform globally by 2030. Each platform must use the same color scheme to create a cohesive user experience while maintaining their existing functionality and features. Update the platform’s styling to apply the specified AeroLink color palette consistently across all UI elements, ensuring accessibility and a modern, aviation-themed design that surpasses industry standards like ForeFlight. Do not modify the platform’s functionality, features, or backend logic—focus solely on updating the design to reflect the uniform branding.

AeroLink Platform Color Scheme
Primary AeroLink Color: #4995fd (AeroLink Blue)
Use for primary buttons, interactive elements (e.g., links, icons), flight routes on maps, and key highlights.
Secondary Color: #003a65 (Deep Blue)
Use for text (headers, body text), dark accents, and backgrounds for high-contrast elements (e.g., headers, footers).
Third Color: #a0d0ec (Sky Light Blue)
Use for backgrounds, secondary elements (e.g., cards, overlays), airspace overlays on maps, and subtle highlights.
Branding and Design Requirements
Apply the AeroLink color scheme consistently across all UI elements in the platform, ensuring a unified aviation-themed design that reflects the AeroLink brand identity. Specific requirements include:

Global Styling:
Update the global CSS file (e.g., /styles/global.css) to define the AeroLink color palette as CSS variables for easy reuse:
--primary-color: #4995fd
--secondary-color: #003a65
--third-color: #a0d0ec
Apply these variables to all UI elements to ensure consistency.
Set the default background of the app to a sky-themed gradient transitioning from #a0d0ec (top) to #6ec0e9 (bottom), reflecting an aviation aesthetic.
Typography:
Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto) for all text, ensuring readability across devices.
Set the default text color to #003a65 for headers, body text, and labels to ensure high contrast against #a0d0ec backgrounds.
Ensure all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast standards (4.5:1 ratio for text, 3:1 for UI elements).
Use font sizes ranging from 14px (small text, e.g., captions) to 24px (headers, e.g., page titles) for readability.
Headers and Navigation:
Update all headers (e.g., page headers, navigation bars) to use a #4995fd background with white text for high visibility.
Apply a subtle shadow (e.g., box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) to headers for depth.
For navigation bars (e.g., sticky nav bar, Hamburger Menu), use #4995fd for the background, white text for menu items, and #a0d0ec for hover states with a 0.3-second fade transition.
Ensure the Hamburger Menu (containing the "Groups" option for AeroSync) uses a community icon (from lucide-react) in white, with the label “Groups” in white text, and opens with a 0.3-second slide animation.
Buttons and Interactive Elements:
Style all primary buttons (e.g., "Create Group", "Log Flight", "Add to Cart") with a #4995fd background, white text, and a 0.3-second hover scale animation (e.g., scale up by 5%).
Use #a0d0ec for secondary buttons (e.g., "Cancel", "View More") with #003a65 text, applying a 0.3-second fade animation on hover.
Apply a 0.3-second button ripple effect (using framer-motion) on click for all interactive elements, using a lighter shade of #4995fd (e.g., #6ec0e9) for the ripple.
Style links and icons (e.g., navigation icons, social interaction icons like likes/comments) with #4995fd, changing to #2f90d4 on hover with a 0.3-second transition.
Cards and Containers:
Update all cards (e.g., group cards, product cards, post cards, flight log cards) to use a #a0d0ec background, #003a65 text for titles/descriptions, and #4995fd for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links).
Apply a subtle border (e.g., border: 1px solid #6ec0e9) and a 0.3-second hover scale animation to cards for interactivity.
Use glassmorphism effects for overlays (e.g., modals, sidebars) with a semi-transparent #a0d0ec background, blur effect, and #003a65 text, ensuring a 0.3-second fade animation when shown/hidden.
Flight Map Specifics:
On the flight map (used in AeroLink, AeroFlight), style flight routes with #4995fd (solid line, 3px width), airspace overlays with a semi-transparent #a0d0ec (50% opacity), and weather overlays with #6ec0e9.
Use a pulsating plane icon (0.5-second pulse animation) in #4995fd for the user’s current position.
Style the Flight Info Sidebar with a glassmorphism effect (semi-transparent #a0d0ec background, blur), #003a65 text, and #ff0000 for terrain proximity warnings, with a 0.3-second slide animation to show/hide.
Forms and Inputs:
Style all form inputs (e.g., group creation wizard, search bars, login forms) with a #a0d0ec background, #003a65 text, and a 4px border radius.
Use #4995fd for focused states (e.g., input borders on focus) with a 0.3-second transition.
Apply autocomplete suggestions (e.g., for airport inputs) with a dropdown styled in #a0d0ec, #003a65 text, and #4995fd for selected items.
Notifications and Alerts:
Style in-app notifications and toasts (using @radix-ui/react-toast) with a #4995fd background for success messages, #ff0000 for errors, and #a0d0ec for info messages, with white text and a 0.3-second fade animation.
Use #003a65 for notification text in high-contrast areas (e.g., on #a0d0ec backgrounds).
Backgrounds and Themes:
Apply a sky-themed background gradient (transitioning from #a0d0ec at the top to #6ec0e9 at the bottom) across all pages to maintain an aviation aesthetic.
For group-specific themes (in AeroSync), allow customization while ensuring the AeroLink color palette is the default (e.g., #a0d0ec background, #4995fd buttons, #003a65 text).
Aviation Flair:
Incorporate aviation-inspired design elements, such as cloud-shaped dividers (styled with #a0d0ec), propeller icons for loading spinners (in #4995fd), and airplane-shaped cursors for interactive elements (e.g., tappable cards).
Include optional aviation sound effects (e.g., a jet takeoff sound on page load), toggleable in user settings, ensuring no impact on performance.
Accessibility:
Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with ARIA labels for all interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, and high contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI elements like buttons).
Provide a high-contrast mode toggle, switching to a #003a65 background with white text for better visibility.
Use @radix-ui components to ensure screen reader compatibility across all UI elements.
Task at Hand
Update the platform’s styling to apply the AeroLink color scheme (#4995fd, #003a65, #a0d0ec) consistently across all UI elements, ensuring a uniform branding experience.
Retain all existing functionality and features (e.g., authentication, flight map, Pilot Shop, social features, groups, notifications), focusing solely on design updates.
Implement the specified design requirements, including global styling, typography, headers, buttons, cards, forms, notifications, backgrounds, and aviation flair.
Ensure the updated design meets accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) and maintains performance (e.g., FCP < 1.2 seconds, TTI < 2 seconds).
Test thoroughly to confirm the new branding is applied uniformly across the platform without affecting functionality, providing a cohesive, aviation-themed user experience.
Final Note
Focus on applying the AeroLink color palette to create a uniform branding experience across the platform, enhancing its aviation-themed aesthetic while ensuring accessibility and performance. Do not modify the platform’s functionality or backend logic—only update the design to reflect the specified color scheme and requirements. Update /docs with the new branding guidelines and implementation details for future reference.
