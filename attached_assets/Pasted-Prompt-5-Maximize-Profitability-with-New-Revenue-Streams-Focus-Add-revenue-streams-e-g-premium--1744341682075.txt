I am tasking Replit AI with maximizing profitability for my full-stack web platform, built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and a database (e.g., MongoDB/PostgreSQL). The app includes various pages, features, and integrations. Make no assumptions about revenueâ€”examine all monetization opportunities, adding premium subscriptions, a marketplace, and ads to increase profitability. Provide explicit, step-by-step instructions for a beginner to implement, test, and deploy the app on Replit Autoscale and Render.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Add Premium Subscriptions**: Create `client/src/pages/Premium.tsx` with a $15/month tier for exclusive content, integrate Stripe: `npm install @stripe/stripe-js`. Add payment form: `<form onSubmit={() => fetch('/api/subscribe', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ plan: 'premium' }) })} />`.
2. **Add Marketplace**: Create `client/src/pages/Marketplace.tsx` for buying/selling items, use MongoDB for listings, integrate Stripe for payments.
3. **Add Banner Ads**: Create `client/src/components/BannerAds.tsx` with banner placements for relevant brands, store ad data in MongoDB.
4. **Test Revenue Features**: Run `npm start`, test subscription payments, marketplace transactions, and ad display.
5. **Deploy**: Configure Replit Autoscale (build: `npm install && cd client && npm run build`, start: `npm start`). Deploy on Render: `git add .`, `git commit -m "Added revenue streams"`, `git push origin main`, click "Clear build cache & deploy".

#### Deliverables
- **Codebase**: Updated with premium subscriptions, marketplace, ads.
- **Docs**: README with monetization features, deployment instructions.
- **Testing**: Report confirming revenue features work, deployment success.
#### Success Criteria
- 20% increase in revenue from new streams.
- Deployment succeeds with no issues.
#### Steps
1. Add premium subscriptions, marketplace, and ads.
2. Test revenue features, deploy, document changes.
